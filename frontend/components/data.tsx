During High School I was playing in an Interntional Academy of the Spanish club Getafe, where I would be spending 4 years playing. After getting a few contract proposals, I decided to reject them all and focus on my studies when I figured out football is not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life for work. As of now, I am still playing football representing my university, nothing too crazy here. '

I find this amazing since you are able to make all these things out of thin air, from automated robots to blockchain technologies to several harmoneously, centered divs. All in all, I'm still just starting my career in this field so let's see what else it's got for us. Right now I'm focusing a bit more on web development as well as algotrading as my main fields, AI is also pretty interesting tho üòØ`
